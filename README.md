<h1>🏫 Campus Navigation System</h1>
<p><em>A Python-based navigation system for VIT Bhopal University campuses.</em></p>

<h2>🚀 About the Project</h2>
<p>
This Project helps students, faculty, and visitors navigate the college campus and helps find classrooms, washrooms, water coolers, and empty classrooms (based on different slots) for study sessions in Academic Block-1 by showing paths or directions between various locations. It is designed to improve campus accessibility and provide an interactive experience.
